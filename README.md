Mascot was created to let my ultimate frisbee team know about the game schedule and our weekly standing. Every week, I am in charge of letting my team know who we're playing against, the colour jersey to wear, and the field number to play at. Now, with this idea, I can hopefully make it easier to inform everyone.

Currently, I am able to scrape using Beautiful Soup from the league website itself (https://perpetualmotion.org/ultimate-schedules-and-standings/) to obtain our weekly schedule and standings, and City of Guelph website (https://guelph.ca/seasonal/sports-field-status/) to get field status.

Some useful commands: 

!st = shows the current standing with the team's places, wins, losses, and points/spirit 

!game = shows the information of the given date informing the opponent team, colour jersey, and field number

!everyone = @everyone the same info as !game but instead, pings everyone on server (useful for certain servers)

!at = take attendence with reaction buttons for teammates to use

!field - scrapes off of City of Guelph site to show field status 

!command - list of commands
